When adding a new issue, please specify the name of the controlled vocabulary you refer to by replacing the right value in the issue title between square brackets. 
Replace  `CONTROLLED_VOCABULARY_NAME` with one of the following values:  `application-layer-protocol`, `communication-method`, `conditions-for-access-and-usage`, `mobility-theme`, `mobility-data-standard`, `georeferencing-method`, `grammar`, `network-coverage`, ` intended-information-service`, `transport-mode`, `update-frequency`. If more than one values are applicable insert them in the title using an additional `[CONTROLLED_VOCABULARY_NAME]`. 

If the issue is generic and valid for all the controlled vocabularies, you can remove the part between square brackets.

Provide a short title summarising the issue, and a full description of the use case and/or the proposal to be implemented.
